for grammar induction call the executable with the command "induce" and if you want the grammar to be saved to disk give an additional argument with the name you want it saved as.

for parsing call the executable with the "parse" command. Parsing needs two arguments that are the location of the rules and lexicon file, these need to be the last to arguments given.
only supported option so far is -i for setting the root element (by default "ROOT")
